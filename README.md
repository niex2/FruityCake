The aim of the project would be to make a food-distribution system that serves vegan / raw foods for schools and hospitals, and it's governed by the community and sustained by the community. So for example there would be a map where you could see how can you help with the making of vegan/raw food supply for the nearby schools/hospitals, and then there could be the possibility to raise money for the making of it, with donations or investments. So the map would show that there are the schools and it would show the current progress of achieving vegan/raw food supply, and you could sign up as paid or volunteer worker, you could send money or offer anything necessary to achieve the vegan/raw food supply of that place. There would be different roles to fill, for example work in the kitchen, transport, legislative work for example lawyers, etc. The map would show the current composition of the team for each area, which roles are filled, which instruments we have, how much&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; supply is needed and things like that, so it would be easy to join the parts together.
